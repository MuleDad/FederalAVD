# Entra Kerberos for Azure Files (Cloud-Only Identities) [Preview]

## Overview

This solution supports using **Entra Kerberos** for authentication to Azure Files for cloud-only identities. This allows you to use FSLogix with Azure Files without requiring an on-premises Active Directory or Entra Domain Services.

The session hosts are Entra ID joined, and users are cloud-only identities in Entra ID.

For the official Microsoft documentation see [Enable Microsoft Entra Kerberos Authentication for hybrid and cloud-only identities on Azure Files](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-files-identity-auth-hybrid-identities-enable?tabs=azure-portal%2Cintune).

## Prerequisites

1. **Identity Solution**: `identitySolution` must be set to `'EntraKerberos-CloudOnly'`.
2. **Session Hosts**: Must be Entra ID joined.
3. **Client Devices**: Windows 10/11 Enterprise/Pro multi-session or Windows Server 2022.

### User Assigned Managed Identity (Optional)

Providing a **User Assigned Managed Identity** is **optional** but recommended. It allows the solution to fully automate the configuration of the Storage Account for Entra Kerberos, specifically the App Registration updates required for Private Link, tag for including Entra groups in security identifiers, and API permissions.

The solution uses a User Assigned Managed Identity to perform the following actions against Microsoft Graph:

1. **Update App Registration**: Adds the required tag `kdc_enable_cloud_group_sids` and `identifierUris` for Private Link (e.g., `api://<storageAccountName>.file.core.windows.net`).
2. **Configure API Permissions**: Adds `User.Read`, `openid`, and `profile` permissions to the App Registration.
3. **Grant Admin Consent**: Grants admin consent for the added permissions so that the storage account can accept Kerberos tickets.

#### Required Permissions

The User Assigned Managed Identity requires the following **Application** permissions (not Delegated) in Microsoft Graph:

| Permission | Type | Reason |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Application.ReadWrite.All` | Application | Required to search for and update the App Registration created by the Storage Account, including adding `identifierUris` and `requiredResourceAccess`. |
| `DelegatedPermissionGrant.ReadWrite.All` | Application | Required to grant Admin Consent (`oauth2PermissionGrants`) for the API permissions. |

#### Creating the Identity and Assigning Permissions

You can use the following PowerShell script to create the User Assigned Managed Identity and assign the required Graph permissions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To run this script successfully, you need permissions in two scopes:
>
> 1. **Entra ID**: You must be a **Privileged Role Administrator** or **Global Administrator**. The `Application Administrator` role is **insufficient** because it cannot grant `Application.ReadWrite.All` for the Microsoft Graph API.
> 2. **Azure Subscription/Resource Group**: You must be a **Contributor** or **Managed Identity Contributor** to create the User Assigned Managed Identity resource.

```powershell
# Parameters
$SubscriptionId = "<Your Subscription ID>"
$ResourceGroupName = "<Your Resource Group Name>"
$IdentityName = "id-avd-storage-automation"
$Location = "<Region>"
$Environment = "AzureCloud" # Options: AzureCloud, AzureUSGovernment

# Set Microsoft Graph environment based on Azure environment
$graphEnvironment = switch ($Environment) {
    "AzureUSGovernment" { "USGov" }
    default { "Global" }
}

# Connect to Azure
Connect-AzAccount -Environment $Environment
Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId $SubscriptionId

# 1. Create the User Assigned Managed Identity
$identity = Get-AzUserAssignedIdentity -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -Name $IdentityName -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
if (-not $identity) {
    New-AzUserAssignedIdentity -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -Name $IdentityName -Location $Location
    $identity = Get-AzUserAssignedIdentity -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -Name $IdentityName
}
Write-Host "Identity Created: $($identity.Name)"

# 2. Assign Graph Permissions
# Connect to Microsoft Graph
Connect-MgGraph -Environment $graphEnvironment -Scopes "AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All", "Application.Read.All"

$sp = Get-MgServicePrincipal -Filter "AppId eq '$($identity.ClientId)'"
$graphSPN = Get-MgServicePrincipal -Filter "AppId eq '00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000'"

# List of required permissions
$permissions = @(
    "Application.ReadWrite.All",
    "DelegatedPermissionGrant.ReadWrite.All"
)

foreach ($permName in $permissions) {
    $appRole = $graphSPN.AppRoles | Where-Object { $_.Value -eq $permName -and $_.AllowedMemberTypes -contains "Application" }
    
    if ($appRole) {
        try {
            New-MgServicePrincipalAppRoleAssignment -ServicePrincipalId $sp.Id -PrincipalId $sp.Id -ResourceId $graphSPN.Id -AppRoleId $appRole.Id
            Write-Host "Assigned $permName" -ForegroundColor Green
        }
        catch {
            Write-Warning "Failed to assign $permName (it might already exist): $($_.Exception.Message)"
        }
    } else {
        Write-Error "Permission $permName not found in Graph Service Principal."
    }
}
```

## What the Solution Does

The solution always performs the following actions when **Entra Kerberos (Cloud-Only)** is selected:

1. **Storage Account Creation**: Creates the Azure Storage Account.
2. **Identity Configuration**: Enables Entra Kerberos authentication on the storage account.
3. **Session Host Configuration**: Automatically configures the session hosts to retrieve the Kerberos token from the cloud.
4. **RBAC Assignments**: Assigns the default share access to `Storage File Data SMB Share Contributor` for all users.

### With User Assigned Managed Identity (Recommended)

If you provide the Resource ID of the Managed Identity with the required permissions:

1. **App Registration Automation**: The solution automatically updates the App Registration associated with the Storage Account:
    * Adds Private Link URIs (e.g., `api://<storageAccountName>.privatelink.file.core.windows.net`) to `identifierUris`.
    * Adds `User.Read`, `openid`, and `profile` to `requiredResourceAccess`.
    * Grants Admin Consent for these permissions.
    * **Cloud Group Support**: Updates the application tags to include `kdc_enable_cloud_group_sids`, enabling support for Entra groups (mandatory for cloud-only identities).
2. **Least Privilege NTFS Permissions**: Configures NTFS permissions on the file shares by assigning only the specified FSLogix group(s), restricting access to authorized users only.

### Without User Assigned Managed Identity

If you do **not** provide the Managed Identity:

1. **Default Permissions**: The storage account NTFS permissions are configured with default permissions that allow **Authenticated Users** to create their user profile folders.
2. **Manual Configuration Required**: You must manually perform the following steps after deployment:
    * **Grant Admin Consent**[^1]:
        1. Navigate to **App registrations** in the Azure Portal.
        2. Select **All applications** and search for the storage account name.
        3. Select **API permissions** and click **Grant admin consent for [Tenant Name]**.
    * **Update Manifest (Private Link)**[^2]:
        1. Navigate to **App registrations** and select the storage account application.
        2. Select **Manifest**.
        3. Locate the `identifierUris` array and add the private link URIs (e.g., `api://<storageAccountName>.privatelink.file.core.windows.net`).
        4. Save the changes.
    * **Enable Cloud Groups**[^3]:
        1. In the **Manifest**, locate the `tags` array.
        2. Add `"kdc_enable_cloud_group_sids"` to the array.
        3. Save the changes.
    * **Configure NTFS Permissions**[^4]:
        1. Since the automated identity was not used, you must manually configure NTFS permissions if the default authenticated users access is insufficient.

> [!Note]
> You could leverage the PowerShell Script located at '.common\scripts\Update-StorageAccountApplications.ps1' within a pipeline to automatically perform the first three tasks in this list.

## Post Deployment Manual Steps

Regardless of whether you use the Managed Identity or not, the following step is required:

* **MFA Exclusion**: The storage account application(s) must be excluded from Conditional Access policies requiring MFA.
    1. Navigate to **Entra ID > Security > Conditional Access**.
    2. Identify policies that enforce MFA for all cloud apps or specific apps.
    3. Exclude the storage account application (Service Principal) created by the deployment. The storage account app should have the same name as the storage account in the conditional access exclusion list. When searching for the storage account app in the conditional access exclusion list, search for: [Storage Account] <your-storage-account-name>.file.<environmentSuffix>. Remember to replace <your-storage-account-name> with the proper value.
